The primary difference is that stats are upgraded only with items, not through battles.\n\nEffort Levels range from 0 to 10 for each stat and can be changed with these items:\n- Wings: Level up to 3\n- Vitamins: Level from 3 to 9\n- Jewels: Level from 9 to 10\n- Berries: Lower level by 1\nHowever, all stats cannot be maxed...",
    "All stats can reach level 3, which is equivalent to an IV of 31. Past this point, stat increases will require Specialization Points (SP). All Pokémon have a total of 14 SP to use, which is enough to max out exactly two stats.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with or do not care about the details, it is enough to know that raising Effort Levels raises stats, and that it is beneficial to only level a Pokémon's important stats past level 3.\n\nThe next page has direct conversions between ELs and IVs/EVs.",

Instead of Pokémon gaining the EVs, you gain essence that can be exchanged for Effort Level raising items at Pokémon Centers.\n\nThe essence you gain from defeating Pokémon is based on their best stats. For example, if a Pokémon has a high Attack stat, it likely drops Attack Effort Essence. You can also use items like the Macho Brace or Power Band to get more essence. These items can be bought at the Department Store in Lapis Lazuli City."],

    "The Effect of Affinity Boosts\n\nWhen a Pokémon receives an Affinity Boost they will use their move directly after the triggering partner, regardless of speed and priority.\nThe move they use will also have its power increased by 30% and will always hit. Moves with less than 50% accuracy will not always hit.\n\nFor additional information on Affinity Boosts, see the \"Affinity Extras\" section."],

Skiddo, Numel and Krabby all have access to abilities that make their Affinity Boosts stronger than other Pokémon. Some moves also have their side effects guaranteed when Affinity Boosted while being random normally, such as Metal Claw.",
    "Bond Abilities\n\nA group of abilities that benefit from affinity boosts are called Bond abilities.\nThese abilities raise a specific stat whenever an Affinity Boost involving the Pokémon with the ability is triggered.\nIt is the Pokémon that received the Affinity Boost that has its stat raised. The Pokémon with the Bond ability is not the only one that can receive the stat boost from the ability."],

    "Poison & Bad Poison\n\nPoison lasts 5 turns and damages a Pokémon by 1/8 of their total HP at the end of each turn.\n\nBad Poison lasts 6 turns and damages a Pokémon by 1/16 of their total HP at the end of the first turn, increasing by 1/16 each turn after.",
    "Burn & Frostbite\n\nBoth Burn and Frosbite last 5 turns and damage the inflicted Pokémon by 1/16 of their total HP at the end of each turn. Burn also halves the Pokémon's Attack, while Frostbite halves the Pokémon's Special Attack.\n\nFreeze\nThere are no moves that inflict Freeze, but it may appear for Boss specific effects. When inflicted with Freeze, a Pokémon has a 20% chance to thaw each turn. Freeze can also be cured by using or getting hit by some moves.",
    "Sleep\n\nSleep has been thoroughly reworked to account for Vagabond specific features like Affinity Boosts and Boss Battles.\n\nSleep lasts exactly 2 turns where the inflicted Pokémon tries to use a move. If a Pokémon is hit by a damaging move while asleep, it wakes up. Dream Eater and indirect damage do not wake sleeping Pokémon. A Pokémon will be immune to sleep the turn it wakes up, and then for as many turns as the Pokémon was asleep before waking up.",

They have passive effects for certain types of Pokémon, and some moves and abilities benefit from their presence.\n\nThere are 5 base types of weather:\n- Winds\n- Sun\n- Rain\n- Sandstorm\n- Snow\n\nThe next pages explain these in detail.",
    "Winds\n\nThis is a new weather condition introduced in Pokémon Vagabond, and affects airborne Pokémon and some wind-based moves.\n\nIf a Pokémon is airborne, either by being Flying-type, the ability Levitate, or other effects such as Magnet Rise or an Air Balloon, they gain a 30% increase to their Speed.\n\nSome wind-based moves are powered up during Winds. This is mentioned in the description of the relevant moves.",
    "Sun & Rain\n\nThese weather conditions compete directly with each other. While Sun increases the power of Fire-type moves by 50% and lowers Water-type moves by 50%, Rain does the opposite. Many moves and abilities interact with these weather conditions.",
    "Sandstorm\n\nDuring a Sandstorm, all Pokémon that are not Rock-, Steel- or Ground-type are damaged for 1/16 of their total HP each turn. Rock-types also have their Special Defense boosted by 50%.\n\nSnow & Hail\n\nIce-types gain a 50% boost to their Defense during Snow.
