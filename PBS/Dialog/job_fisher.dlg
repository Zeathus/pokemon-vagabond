/speaker Ivan
> Great! Fishing can be both a relaxing and an intense activity, all depending on what kind of Pokémon you try to hook.
> Here, I'll give you this Fishing Rod, to set you out on your voyage.

[JOB_FISHER_1,2]
/speaker Ivan
> Now that you have a rod, let me explain how to properly hook a fish...

[JOB_FISHER_1,3]
/speaker Ivan
> To begin, why don't you try to hook a Magikarp from the lake outside?
> You don't have to catch the Magikarp with a Pokéball, successfully hooking it is enough to prove yourself.
> If you can do that, I am willing to tutor you into a master fisherman.

[JOB_FISHER_1,4]
/speaker Ivan
> Try hooking a Magikarp in the lake outside. If you can do that, I am willing to tutor you into a master fisherman.

[JOB_FISHER_1,5]
/speaker Ivan
> You hooked a Magikarp? Good going!

[JOB_FISHER_1,6]
/speaker Ivan
> I'll let you keep that rod, and if you can prove you have raised your skill level, I'll teach you some new techniques.
> For your next challenge, I want you to try hooking two different Pokémon.

[JOB_FISHER_1,7]
> \ts[2]You got the job as a Fisher!
> \ts[1]You can track the Pokémon Ivan requested you to hook in the Trainer menu.

[JOB_FISHER_2,0]
/speaker Ivan
> I hope your fishing adventures are going well. Do you remember what Pokémon I tasked you to hook?

[JOB_FISHER_2,1]
/speaker Ivan
> The first Pokémon is Staryu, which you can hook at or close to sea.
> The second Pokémon is Poliwhirl. You're more likely to find that one in a lake somewhere.
> You will have to figure out where to find them yourself, though the Habitat Dex I've heard is in development would help.
> I believe someone at the G[.]P[.]O[.] could hook you up with it, even though it's still in development.
> I've heard the fishing encounter list in the Habitat Dex even shows what Pokémon you have previously hooked.

[JOB_FISHER_2,2]
/speaker Ivan
> You managed to hook both Staryu and Poliwhirl? Good job my aspiring fisher!

[JOB_FISHER_2,3]
/speaker Ivan
> To celebrate your achievement I will [R]teach you a new technique[/].
> This technique is called [R]Powerful Hookset[/] and it allows you to temporarily stun hooked fish, stopping their movement.
> You can only stun so often however, so pay attention to the [R]Stun Gauge[/] next time you fish.

[JOB_FISHER_3,0]
/speaker Ivan
> With this new technique, I hope you will be able to hook a new set of more challenging Pokémon.

[JOB_FISHER_3,1]
/speaker Ivan
> The Pokémon are Gyarados, Mantine and Cloyster.
> Gyarados can be found where there are [R]waterfalls[/]. While both Mantine and Cloyster are found at the [R]western sea[/].

[JOB_FISHER_3,2]
/speaker Ivan
> You managed to hook all the three Pokémon? Very impressive, those were far more challenging than the previous.

[JOB_FISHER_3,3]
/speaker Ivan
> To celebrate your achievement I will [R]teach you a new technique[/].
> This technique is called [R]Quick Move[/] and it allows you to move the green bar quicker than usual.
> You simply need to hold down a button to do so. Try it the next time you fish!

[JOB_FISHER_4,0]
/speaker Ivan
> As for your next targets...\nThese will be a real challenge.

[JOB_FISHER_4,1]
/speaker Ivan
> The Pokémon are Wailord, Seadra and Wailrein.
> Wailord and Seadra can be found [R]at sea[/]. For Walrein however, you will have to explore [R]icy waters[/] to the north-east.
