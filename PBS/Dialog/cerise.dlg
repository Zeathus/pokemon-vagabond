/speaker Cerise
> You truly are a relentless one.
> Luckily for you, that makes us two!

[CERISE_ENCOUNTER_5,1]
/speaker Cerise
> I've begun to enjoy this contest of ours. There are few sources of growth as good as a rivalry.

[CERISE_ENCOUNTER_6,0]
/speaker Cerise

[CERISE_ENCOUNTER_7,0]
/speaker Cerise
> I have almost gathered all the information I need to find and challenge all [R]the swords[/].
> If you want in, you'd better make me believe it!

[CERISE_ENCOUNTER_7,1]
/speaker Cerise
> When I started my journey to challenge [R]the swords[/], I was expecting it to be a lonesome one.

[CERISE_ENCOUNTER_8,0]
/speaker Cerise

> Either way, it has made things more interesting.

[CERISE_COBALION_SCORIA_CANYON]
/speaker Cerise
> The mark you see in the wall here is said to have been left by [R]the azure sword[/].
> This valley marks the transition between two biomes, the mountains to the north and the drylands to the south.
> The mountain Pokémon were supposedly encroaching on the dryland Pokémon's territory, causing a feud between them.
> It is believed this dispute was resolved by [R]the azure sword[/], negotiating peace between both parties.
> This slash mark is thought to be [R]the azure sword[/]'s way to put the peace treaty into stone, quite literally.
> No major conflicts between the Pokémon in this area has been documented since.

[CERISE_COBALION_SCORIA_VALLEY]
/speaker Cerise
> When it comes to rumored sightings of [R]the azure sword[/], few places have as many as Scoria Valley.
> With its powerful hind legs, its silhouette can be seen leaping from cliff to cliff.
> Yet, [R]the azure sword[/] is not known for staying in one place.
> Rather, it patrols the various areas of Rokk, keeping an eye on the wildlife.
> That way it can step in if a conflict arises, and ensure a peaceful outcome.

[CERISE_TERRAKION_FELDSPAR]
/speaker Cerise
> Whilst traveling, I heard folktales about [R]the maroon sword[/] protecting the Pokémon of this area.
> According to the stories, this lake served as a spot for wild Pokémon to socialize in a peaceful manner.
> However, this peace was intercepted...
> Large and aggressive Pokémon arrived from afar and made the lake their own, pushing away all others.
> This is when [R]the maroon sword[/] appeared from the cliffs of Mt[.] Pegma.
> They challenged the aggressive Pokémon to a contest of strength, and made quick work of them at that.
> After an overwhelming loss, the invaders promptly left the area.
> From that point on, the wild Pokémon could once again socialize in peace, protected by [R]the maroon sword[/].

[CERISE_VIRIZION_LAZULI_RIVER]
/speaker Cerise
> I caught wind of a rumor that [R]the verdant sword[/] had been sighted by Lazuli River.
> The witness told of a quadrupedal figure guiding a group of lost infant Pokémon back to their parents.
> This behavior matches [R]the verdant sword[/]. Its duty is to keep the grassland creatures safe.
> It must have already been absorbed by other duties, as there's no longer any trace of it here.
